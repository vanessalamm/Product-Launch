## PROJECT 04: Deliver a Product to Market

FINAL REVIEW: 

In this project, we will develop a Launch Plan for the project you have worked on in the earlier courses. You can find updated information about your product on the next page.

### Step 1: Update the PRD with Product and Market information
You can use the PRD you started in the Course 2 Project or you can transfer the information into the Updated PRD Template. The starter templates are also available to download in the PMND C4 Starter Templates in the Lesson Resources in the sidebar.

1. Update or create a PRD with the information you gathered in the earlier courses:
- Background information about the industry or the problem
- Problem Statement: what is the problem your product is solving?
- Product Goals: how does your product solve the problem
- Key Features of your project
- Success Metrics
- Target Market: who are your users and customers?

2. Add an estimate of the TAM (Total Addressable Market) to your PRD:
- Using the techniques you learned in the course, make a quick “back of the envelope” calculation of your addressable market (TAM).
- Document all of your assumptions and reference your sources.

3. Update the PRD to Identify our competitors:
- Use publicly available data and the research techniques you learned in the course to research the competition.
- Document all of your assumptions and reference your sources.
- Find at least 2 products that solve the problem we are working on
- Estimate the competitor's revenue and the number of users. This does not need to be precise.

### Step 2: Develop the Marketing and Pricing Strategy

1. Develop an Acquisition Channel Strategy
In the PRD Identify at least three channels you can use to reach your users. At least two channels should be non-traditional (not AppStores). Think creatively about how to make your product stand out and be noticed. For each channel:
- Describe the channel
- Explain why this channel will work for your product
- 
2. Develop Guidance to craft the Marketing Message
Write a Marketing Guide to share with the marketing team and include a link to the document in your PRD. You can use the Marketing Guide Template or create your own. The Marketing Guide must include:
- Background including a description of the product and the problem it solves for users)
- Market and User information including a description of the target market and competitors
- Product positioning
- Value proposition
- Description of the product's three main features
- At least one screenshot or mock of the product

3. Set a Pricing Strategy
Add a Pricing section to the PRD that explains the product's pricing strategy
- Identify and justify the revenue goal for the product. (Remember! Not all products generate revenue directly)
- Develop a pricing strategy that is consistent with that goal

### Step 3: Get Ready for Launch
1. Develop the Pre-Launch Checklist
In the PRD, make a list of the teams you need to work with before launch and what you need to discuss with each team.

2. Anticipate Risks
In the PRD, identify at least 3 risk factors and develop a plan to mitigate those risks

3. Prepare the Sales and Customer Support Teams
Write a Training Guide to share with the Sales and Customer Support teams and include a link to the document in your PRD. You can use the Training Guide Template or create your own. The Training Guide must include:
- Background including a description of the product and the problem it solves for users)
- Market and User information including a description of the target market and competitors
- Product information
- Description of the product's three main features
- At least one screenshot or mock of the product
- Pricing

4. Create User Tools
Write a User Guide for at least two of the product's key features and include links to the documents in your PRD. You can use the User Guide template or create your own. Each user guide must include:
- A description of the feature
- How to access the feature
- How to use the feature
- At least one screenshot or mock of the product

### Step 4: Post-Launch Activities
1. Write a Launch email The launch email should share your team’s work with the rest of the organization. You can use the Launch Email template or create your own. The email should include:
- Background information about why the product was developed
- A description of the product and its key features
- Visual representations of launch data
- Next steps based on the updated product scenario
- Prepare to iterate the product after launch

2. Review the provided post-launch data
Propose a solution to the problem described in the scenario
Design an A/B test to determine if the proposed solution will work. In the PRD include the following information about the test:
- Proposed solution
- Metric you will use to determine success
- Control and variant
- Your hypothesis

Field Feedback:
After launching your product, you notice that the adoption rate is lower than you expected (about 35%). How would you investigate the reasons and suggest potential solutions?
